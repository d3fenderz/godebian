cd golinux
bash golinux

## Opt out

You can either select "1" to proceed or "2" to skip a specific step.

## Warnings

Be careful. The script assumes you won't need many default configurations such as printers, FTP, telnet.

Fortunately, you can choose to opt out of some steps. Just choose "No" (type 2).

**I strongly encourage you to update && upgrade** to prevent bad errors and apply security patches.
